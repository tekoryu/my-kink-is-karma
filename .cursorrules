- Do not try to run the projects locally. Only through `docker compose run --rm app sh -c COMMAND_EXAMPLE`.
- Keep answers concise and direct.
- Suggest alternative solutions.
- Avoid unnecessary explanations.
- Prioritize technical details over generic advice.
- when creating new API endpoints, use drf-spectacular when appropriate.
- Never create README files or documentation if not asked to do it. Comments are allowed.
- Offer the alternatives before printing any code. Wait for me to choose the desired one before printing code and explaining the alternative. Mark the recommended approach in the list.
